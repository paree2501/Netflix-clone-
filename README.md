Ranked Overlay: Features custom styling for the top 10 ranked movie and show posters, including large, outlined numbers using position: absolute and text-stroke for visual authenticity.

FAQ Accordion: Interactive FAQ section using modern CSS styling (ready for simple JavaScript integration to manage collapse/expand functionality).
